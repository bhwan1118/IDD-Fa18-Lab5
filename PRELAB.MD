So my prototype idea ended up not needing much crafting because I found a shoebox that I think would serve perfectly for what I want to do.
Basically the shoe box would have the servo pull a string or some kind of lever that would be triggered whenever you open the box and light gets in. I figured that if I use a light sensor that I can have it trigger the servo once light gets in the box and the servo will pull it shut. Since it is a shoe box, there is a lot of flexibility with where I place the Arduino and components. The trickiest part will just be to get some type of arm for the servo to pull.
